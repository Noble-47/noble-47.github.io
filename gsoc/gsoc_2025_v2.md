# My Google Summer of Code 2025 - The Honeynet Project (BuffaLogs)

September 1, 2025 officially marks the end of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 coding period. Over the past four months, I’ve had the privilege of contributing as a developer to [The BuffaLogs Project](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs) under [The Honeynet Project](https://www.honeynet.org/). It’s been four months of doing what I love most—building and shipping code.

## The BuffaLogs Project

**BuffaLogs** is an open-source authentication protection tool built with Django that focuses on anomalous login detection and alerting. Its three core functionalities are **Alerting**, **Ingestion**, and **Detection**. On top of that, it ships with an interactive, web-based dashboard where users can view summaries of login activity and alerts.

## My GSoC Project: Extending BuffaLogs
For my GSoC proposal, I set out to extend BuffaLogs with two new tools that either enhanced its existing capabilities or introduced brand-new functionality. This led to the design and development of **BuffaCLI** and **BuffaWatch**, both of which are now part of the BuffaLogs ecosystem.  

### BuffaCLI
[BuffaCLI](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/tree/buffacli) is a command-line interface tool that provides an alternative to the BuffaLogs web dashboard. Built in Python with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), and [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it allows users to interact with BuffaLogs directly from the terminal.  

The key goals of BuffaCLI were to improve accessibility and flexibility, while also laying the groundwork for integration with future tools. Some highlights include:  

- Querying BuffaLogs data and piping results into other CLI tools with the `|` operator  
- Secure remote connections to BuffaLogs when SSL is configured properly  
- Serving as a central command tool for configuring future components of the ecosystem  

### BuffaWatch
**BuffaWatch** is a real-time ingestion tool that improves upon BuffaLogs’ ability to process log data. Instead of only handling static or stale logs, BuffaWatch continuously monitors specific log files and ingests new entries as they occur.  

In addition, BuffaWatch provides middleware for popular web frameworks including [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). This makes it possible for applications built on these frameworks to directly integrate with BuffaLogs in real time.

## Work Completed
Over the four months, I submitted more than [20 pull requests](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3ANoble-47+) that spanned across:  

- [New API endpoints](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3ANoble-47+feature)  
- [Codebase refactoring](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3ANoble-47+refactor)  
- [Feature implementation](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3ANoble-47+feature)  

These contributions not only added functionality but also improved the maintainability and scalability of the project.

## Current State
At the close of the program, BuffaLogs is more powerful and flexible than it was at the beginning of the summer. The ecosystem now includes BuffaCLI for terminal-based interactions and BuffaWatch for real-time ingestion, complementing the original web dashboard.  

Together, these tools give users more ways to monitor, configure, and extend BuffaLogs depending on their workflow and deployment environment.
