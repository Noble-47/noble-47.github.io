# My Google Summer of Code 2025 - The Honeynet Project (BuffaLogs)

September 01, 2025 officially marks the end of the coding period of Google Summer of Code 2025 of which I participated in as a contributor to [The BuffaLogs Project](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs) under the [The Honeynet Project](https://www.honeynet.org/) organization. It's been 4 months of doing what I do best -- coding.


## The BuffaLogs Project

**BuffaLogs** is an opensource authentication protection tool built with django that specializes in anomalous logins detection and alerting. It has 3 core functionalities, **Alerting**, **Ingestion** and **Detection**. It also implements an interactive web based dashboard for viewing summaries of user or login alerts.

## My Gsoc Project And How it Improves BuffaLogs
My proposed project which got accepted by my organization involved building of two tools which either augumented the current capabilities of the project or gave it new functionalities. I proposed the building of **BuffaCLI** and **BuffaWatch** as new tools in the **BuffaLogs'** ecosystem.

### BuffaCLI
[BuffaCLI](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/tree/buffacli) is a CLI tool that serves as an alternative the the web-based dashboard provided by **BuffaLogs** and provide insights into the current configuration of **BuffaLogs** such as the current ingestion source enabled or alert medium selected. It is a python based tool built with [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at its core. The main goal of this project was to provide users a means of interacting with **BuffaLogs** from within the terminal. But while providing this means, **BuffaCLI** also makes it possible to 

* Integrate **BuffaLogs** with other CLI tools by pipelining its query result with the `|` operator
* Connect to **BuffaLogs** remotely if `ssl` is setup properly
* Have a central tool for configuration of future tools that may be added to the **BuffaLogs** ecosystem

### BuffaWatch
**BuffaWatch** is an ingestion tool that enables real time ingestion of log data as opposed to processing stale data. It does this by monitoring specific log files for new data.It also provides middleware codes for [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) for direct interaction with **BuffaLogs**

## Work Done
During the four months coding period I submitted over [20 pull requests](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3ANoble-47+) that revolved around: 

- [adding new endpoint](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed is%3Apr author%3ANoble-47%20 feature)
- [codebase refactoring](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Apr%20author%3ANoble-47%20%20refactor) 
- and [feature implementation](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed is%3Apr author%3ANoble-47%20 feature)
